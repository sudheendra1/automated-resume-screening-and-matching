# Building-a-Job-Description-and-Resume-Matching-System-With-Python-Using-Machine-Learning

Efficient resume screening is crucial for successful recruitment processes. This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop an automated system for resume screening and candidate matching. By training a model on a dataset of resumes and job descriptions, we employ text classification and similarity matching techniques to identify the best candidates for a given role. The system evaluates various factors, including skills, experience, and qualifications, streamlining the recruitment process and reducing the time-to-hire. Initial deployment shows that our model can accurately match candidates to job requirements, improving hiring efficiency and candidate selection quality.

## Features

- **Job Description Input:** Recruiters can input job descriptions into the system.
- **Resume Upload:** Candidates can upload their resumes for matching against job descriptions.
- **Matching Algorithm:** The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to match job descriptions with resumes based on similarity scores.
- **Result Presentation:** Matched resumes are presented to recruiters with similarity scores and relevant details.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Backend development using Python programming language.
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the backend server and handling HTTP requests.
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend design and layout using Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly UI.
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Libraries such as scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms for text similarity matching.
- **HTML/CSS:** Frontend markup and styling for web pages.
